# Security Policy

## ðŸš¨ Security Issue Resolution

This project recently experienced a security incident where Firebase API keys were accidentally committed to the repository. The following measures have been implemented to prevent future occurrences:

### Immediate Actions Taken

1. **âœ… Removed hardcoded secrets** from `src/lib/firebase.ts`
2. **âœ… Added environment variable validation** to prevent missing configurations
3. **âœ… Updated .gitignore** to prevent future secret commits
4. **âœ… Created environment template** (`env.example`) for secure setup
5. **âœ… Implemented CI/CD security scanning** with CodeQL and dependency audits

### Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variables
- All sensitive data must be stored in environment variables
- Use `.env.local` for local development (never commit this file)
- Use `env.example` as a template for required variables
- Validate environment variables at runtime

#### Git Security
- Never commit API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Regular security scans with automated tools
- Pre-commit hooks for secret detection

#### Firebase Security
- Regenerate API keys if compromised
- Use Firebase Security Rules for database access
- Enable Firebase Authentication for user management
- Monitor Firebase usage for suspicious activity

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainer directly with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Measures in Place

### Automated Security
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Weekly security code scanning
- **Dependency Audits**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret detection alerts
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local validation before commits

### CI/CD Security
- Environment variable validation in builds
- Security audits in deployment pipeline
- Automated dependency updates
- Security-focused code review requirements

### Development Security
- Environment variable templates
- Git hooks for commit validation
- Linting rules for security best practices
- Documentation for secure development

## Environment Setup

### Local Development
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual Firebase configuration values
3. Never commit `.env.local` to version control
4. Use `npm run type-check` to validate configuration

### Production Deployment
1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
3. Enable security scanning in repository settings
4. Monitor deployment logs for configuration errors

## Security Checklist

Before each commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Security tests passing
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No sensitive data in commit messages

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Remove secrets from code
   - Update .gitignore if needed
   - Clean Git history if necessary

2. **Assessment**
   - Identify scope of exposure
   - Check logs for unauthorized access
   - Document timeline of events
   - Assess impact on users/data

3. **Remediation**
   - Generate new credentials
   - Update all affected systems
   - Implement additional safeguards
   - Update documentation

4. **Prevention**
   - Review security practices
   - Enhance automated detection
   - Update team training
   - Improve development processes
